[*][QUOTE=iceeedr;2629554]Would you have an updated "how to"? I tried installing yesterday, however the application is totally different from the images, probably because of updates ...[/QUOTE]
    Sublime Text version changed and the new version as a very new theme, also, I updated the colors schemes used, them, the images became pretty different. But the text inside the images still the names, so you should be able to just ignore the colors/theme/fonts and just follow written the text.




[*][QUOTE=CrazY.;2606261]Autocomplete doesn't work with "includes included into other includes".
    AmxxEditor syntax doesn't auto set in include files.
    [/QUOTE]
    I am not sure why this is happening, as by default that should be working.

    Anyways, you can force all files with `.inc` extension to open with the correct syntax:

    [*] Opening a `.inc` file
    [*] And going on the menu `View -> Syntax -> Open all with current extension as... -> Amxmodx -> AmxmodxPawn`
