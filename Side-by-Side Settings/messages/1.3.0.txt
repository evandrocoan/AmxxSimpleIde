-------------------------------------
Side-by-Side Settings - Version 1.3.0
-------------------------------------

This update contains a brand new command for Sublime Text 3 users:

  Side-by-Side: Select a File

By default, this command is bound to the Ctrl+K, Ctrl+S key-chord.

-------------------------------
Using the Select a File Command
-------------------------------
The "select a file" command opens a quick panel that displays all of the 
.sublime-settings and .sublime-keymap files that Sublime Text knows about
(note that files located in the Packages/User directory are filtered out of
this list; more on why it does this in a second). When a file in the quick panel
is selected, it becomes the "left" (or "top", depending on your settings) panel
in the comparison window. The "right" (or "bottom") panel will contain the
corresponding user settings file, typically located in the Packages/User
directory (hence why files in Packages/User are filtered out of the list).

Side-by-Side Settings tries to do the correct thing depending on the file you
select in the quick panel. If the file you select is a platform-specific
settings file (e.g. Default/Preferences (Windows).sublime-settings), the
corresponding user file that gets opened will be Preferences.sublime-settings
(in the Packages/User directory). This is due to the fact that platform-
specific files in the User directory are ignored by Sublime Text. Likewise, if
you select a .sublime-keymap file, the appropriate platform-specific
.sublime-keymap file in the User directory will be opened.
